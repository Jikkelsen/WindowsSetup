# WindowsSetup
Personalized script to setup Windows Computers. 

Download the `RunInPowershell.ps1` file, and run it in a powershell window in administratormode. It will do the following:

* Remove a lot of Windows bloat 

* Shows hidden files in Explorer

* Shows File extensions in Explorer

* Enables Dark Mode

* Opens the `display settings`, to set display at 100% scaling

* Opens `Performance Settings`, to set to maximum performance

* Opens `Battery Settings`, to do the same as above

* Opens `Ninite` set to download preferred programs. Waiting for Windows own package manager to deprecate this step.
